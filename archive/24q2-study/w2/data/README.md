# DL-holographic-conductivity
### There is the code for deep learning black hole metrics from optical conductivity.  
#### 1.You can download "the source code" document and run the manytimes.py code to train the neural network.  
#### 2.The "training data" document contains all the input data we used.  
#### 3.For all the results (.png or .gif or .pdf), we put them together in the "training process and results of RN-AdS black hole metrics" document.
