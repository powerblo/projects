# draft
## introduction
I am interested in studying theoretical physics as it is the frontier of natural science, a natural application of modern mathematics, and tenable to be approached from a variety of angles. Within this field, I am particularly interested in further understanding various types of holography and the application of machine learning methods as an aide in finding directions of research in high energy physics, and would like to contribute to its further development by pursuing a PhD at [Uni].

## uni specific interest : TO WRITE
I would like to conduct research at the [Department of Physics (of Uni X)] for [their focus on integrating machine learning methods with physics/their research projects on fields in my interest].
- UWashington : Professor Paquette's research in proposing and utilising holographic dualities interests me in particular.

## prof park : TO WRITE
During 2023, I participated in research on holographic calculation of correlation functions under supervision by Prof. Chanyong Park. Alongside studying QFT and surveying similar developments in testing AdS/CFT, I learned to use Mathematica for calculations and data analysis. While we were able to confirm a correspondence in most cases for UV and IR limits, I ran into difficulties obtaining analytical results for three point functions. This was resolved by imposing a spacetime rotation symmetry, but I would be interested in further investigating this problem by finding numerical asymptotics. I continued participating in similar research into 2024, specifically relating p-brane geometries to expanding universe metrics.

- add sentences relating to uni specific interests?

## prof hwang
Simultaneously, I worked on finding correspondences between first-last passage and potential problems under supervision by Prof. Chiok Hwang. As I was also taking a course in machine learning, I learned how to use PyTorch and its parallel programming/GPU acceleration functions for numerical calculations. We used MCMC to sample the point where a particle first and last passes through a surface via diffusion to find which conjectured correspondence of two was valid, but our results suggested neither were true. After altering the methods like disabling parallelisation or changing sampling algorithm, we came to the conclusion that the Feynman-Kac relation could not explain these results.
### potential questions
- why didnt you publish this result?
    - time constraints due to exchange student plans?
- what are the physical interpretations of this result?
    - not able to interpret : i dont think is good answer

## summer : CURRENT EVENTS
During the latter half of 2024, I expanded upon my understanding of machine learning and quantum computing. I participated in a summer internship under supervision of Prof. Keunyeong Kim where I encountered the AdS/DL model, an interpretable physically informed model. After learning to use it by reproducing papers on lattice QCD holography, I conducted a project to learn the interpolating function in a MOND model given initial and final dynamic data. As I implemented the physics model independently, it was prone to errors and not optimsed, and I would like to further improve this model to account for true astronomical data.
In autumn, I worked together with a team to participate in the Korean Physics Society undergrad research competition, in performing quantum circuit optimisation by solving a modified version of the travelling salesman problem. The large number of nodes for even a few qubits made classical solutions untenable, and I used a reinforcement learning model to reduce the calculation time. I learned how to use several modern models like MHA and LSTM, and experience on how to adapt them to the data and constraints of our problem.
Simultaneously, we investigated techniques in deep learning to solving an inverse spectral problem, recovering the potential of a system given its energy spectrum. The problem was very broad in scope and not well documented, so we started with solving a variety of simple test problems. After running into various problems, we identified the issues with a one-particle system to be high degeneracy and singular behaviour of the potential. Following this, we looked into alternatives
