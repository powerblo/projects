- Exchange student in UC Berkeley

My experiences in the ROK Air Force, a university orchestra, and as an exchange student at UC Berkeley have all taught me to adapt and work well in diverse settings. Each role gave me skills in discipline, collaboration, and cultural awareness that I believe will be valuable in graduate school.

In the ROK Air Force, I worked as an interpreter on a base shared with the U.S. Air Force, where I handled not only translation but also customer service, tech support, and administrative work. Six months in, my senior was dismissed unexpectedly, and I had to take on his responsibilities while balancing my own. This forced me to find ways to streamline my work and create an efficient workflow, which I developed within a month. This experience taught me that discipline is not just about following orders—it’s also about setting high standards for yourself and working efficiently to reach them. This approach has prepared me to manage complex tasks in my future studies.

My time in my university’s orchestra, where I play the clarinet, also taught me the importance of balancing personal effort with group commitment. Our performance in autumn 2023 was a high point, as we worked to bring together new members after years without live performances due to COVID. As someone who often takes on an organizing role, I understood that the challenge was not just musical but also about keeping people engaged. This experience taught me how to create a motivating environment, an ability that I know will be useful in collaborative research settings.

Finally, my semester at UC Berkeley gave me a new perspective on both academics and diversity. Although I initially chose Berkeley because it was the best option my university offered, I quickly came to value its open and collaborative academic culture. I noticed that students there were much more active in asking questions, which encouraged me to engage more actively myself. Outside the classroom, I experienced a level of diversity and openness that was new to me, coming from a more homogeneous culture in Korea. This made me realize the importance of diverse viewpoints and strengthened my commitment to working in multicultural environments.

Through these experiences, I’ve become more adaptable, collaborative, and culturally aware. I am excited to bring these skills to graduate school, where I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to a diverse academic community.
